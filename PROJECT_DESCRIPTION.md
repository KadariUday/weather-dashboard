# SkySense Weather Dashboard - Project Description

**SkySense** is a professional-grade, full-stack weather web application designed to deliver real-time meteorological data with an immersive user experience. Built using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** for the frontend, this project bridges specific data processing with modern, responsive interface design.

At its core, SkySense integrates the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch live weather conditions, 5-day forecasts, and hourly trends for any city worldwide. The application goes beyond basic reporting by calculating advanced metrics like **Chance of Rain** (derived from forecast algorthims) and real-time **UV Index** based on geolocation coordinates. A valid, rigorously tested backend ensures error handling for network issues or invalid inputs, providing a robust user experience.

The standout feature of SkySense is its **Interactive World Map**, powered by **Leaflet.js**. This allows users to visually explore global weather patterns, click on specific regions, and instantly retrieve local data through smart reverse-geocoding. This interactivity transforms the application from a simple lookup tool into a dynamic exploration platform.

On the frontend, the application features a **Glassmorphism-inspired UI** with a card-based layout that adapts seamlessly across devices. It includes a sophisticated personalization suite:
*   **Theme System**: Users can toggle between a sleek "SkySense Navy" dark mode and a crisp light mode, with preferences persisted via local storage.
*   **Unit Conversion**: A global toggle instantly converts all temperature data between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
*   **Favorites Manager**: Users can pin frequently visited cities for quick access.

SkySense demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, API integration, and modern UI/UX principles, managing to be both a functional utility and a visually engaging product. It highlights the capability to handle complex state management (favorites, themes, units) without relying on heavy frontend frameworks, showcasing a deep understanding of core web technologies.
